A quick explanation on how to run TC7:


Initial conditiond and data after 1 day are presented in REF0007.cdf file. There, fields are given as their spectral transform coefficients, instead of velocities, vorticity and divergence is used.

To create initial conditions, one should have an *exo file with grid AND variables 'vals_node_var1', etc. in afile. The easiest way to create such a file is to run one of other test cases (TC2, TC3,...) with a needed grid file and wait till the first time step is written to an *exo file (that is, do not use NetCDF output and interpolation, we need exodus grid structure and  variables on a navite grid).

Once the file above is created, rename it to have extension *.nc (ncl won't open *.g). Then one should run 'tc7_write_IC' to have TC7 initial data interpolated and recorded. Change the extension of the file back to *g. After that, the test is ready to run.
