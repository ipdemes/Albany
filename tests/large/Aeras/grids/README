Naming convention for meshes
----------------------------

* uniform_## is a uniform mesh with NE = ##

All other meshes are of the form STRING_##_x#.g or STRING_##_x#-s#.g:

* STRING refers to where the grid is refined:
	- equator = a band from approx 35 S to 35 N around the globe (for SWTC 1)
	- mountain = a region slightly larger than the SWTC 5 mountain
	- north = the whole northern hemisphere (for Polvani and JW tests)
	- quadrant = a single equatorial panel of the cube (for APE)

* ## refers to the equivalent of NE in the coarse region

* x# refers to the ration between the equivalent of NE in the fine region
  and the same in the coarse region.

* s# refers to the number of times the smoothing operator was applied to the
  mesh. For now let's pretend this is a black box, but I may add documentation
  on the different types of smoothing in the future.

Examples:

1) uniform_15 is the same mesh as just setting NE=15 in the namelist. Note that
   the results will not be bit-for-bit because of the element orientation.

2) equator_6_x4_s1 starts with the uniform NE=6 grid, but then refines an
   equatorial band to look like the NE=24 grid (x4 => 6*4). The grid is then
   smoothed once.

3) north_15_x2 starts with the uniform NE=15 grid, but then refines then
   northern hemisphere to look like the NE=30 grid. It is not smoothed.
