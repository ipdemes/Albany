This cause employs the same mesh employed for Subdivision but the mesh is tetra10's.

As a means of checking the character of the fields, we simulate the mesh chosen for Barycentric 
subdivision with higher-order tetrahedral elements. The fields are smoother and the recovered fields
look pretty good.

You can run the small algebra script

algebra KfieldTet10.e KfieldTet10Alg.e < algTet.i &

to obtain arithmetic averages of the stress fields for ease of visualization.

The recovered fields look defendable but that would imply we can use a 12-noded wedge.
