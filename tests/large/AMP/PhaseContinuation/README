IMPORTANT

*****************

File LaserCenter.txt MUST be present in the folder directory
where you run this problem.

LaserCenter.txt contains the position of the laser as a function
of time. This is the structure of the file:

time x-coordinate z-coordinate Power_Flag

where x- and z-coordinate are the position of the laser center at time t
and power_flag is equal to 1 if laser is active and 0 otherwise.

Note that LaserCenter.txt is an input file.
