Fix exception that gets thrown for serial runs of OBC coupling. dgdp->NumVectors() != testSensValues.size()

Fix parallel bug with OBC coupling (parallel output?, glitch with OBC_PatchTest in parallel.)

Once OBC bugs are fixed, get rid of OBCPatchTestSetup test, as it is redundant, and rename tests with "diffusion" and "mechanics".  Maybe create mechanics versions of the diffusion tests?

Create AlbanyAnalysis test for OBC coupling (OBC_Crack and OBC_PatchTest take too long).

Create proper tangent for OBC coupling







Clean up OptimizationBasedCoupling test.


Fix parallel bug in lsfit BC.

Fix parallel bug with Peridigm exodus output that occurs when some processors have zero elements

Debug Peridigm variable output in Albany
