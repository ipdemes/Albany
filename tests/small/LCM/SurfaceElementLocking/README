Examining the volume of average of J in a localization element

The boundary conditions are specified in the Mathematica notebook, PrescribedF.nb, Prescribed F.pdf

J varies throughout a single localization element

1. Test without volume averaging: inputNoVolJ.yaml
2. Test with volume averaging: inputVolJ.yaml

Gold copies for each case are given in outNoVolJGold.e and outVolJGold.e, respectively.

This might become a unit test in the future. I am leaving this as an example for now because it also verifies kiniematic output for the localization elements.
