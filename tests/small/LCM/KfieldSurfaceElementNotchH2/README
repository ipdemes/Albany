Comparing two cases with the same flavor of the preconditioner

The defaut is to use the most recent flavor of reducing the condition number through a change of units.

Common material file:  materialsScaledLocalHarderTera.yaml

1. Albany -  inputAllLocalHarderTera.yaml

2. AlbanyT - inputAllLocalHarderTeraT.yaml

With Albany, the convergence is quite good. I am able to obtain an inverse to 1e-10 quickly. With AlbanyT, I can only get to 1e-5 in 500 iterations. 

The condition number looks terrible. I need to check on smaller problems to understand if my dimensional analysis is indeed correct.
