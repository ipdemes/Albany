This file lists the work that is still needed to finish 
refactoring ATO to work with Tpetra/Thyra instead of 
Epetra/EpetraExt, in no particular order (dependencies 
b/w action items are noted).  

1. Test / debug (if necessary) Tpetra function ReplaceDiagonalValues,
currently in Albany::Utils (should ultimately be moved to the 
Tpetra::CrsMatrix class). This function is used in the 
ATOT::XFEM_Preconditioner.cpp class. Currently there is no example
for this preconditioner. 

2. Have Mark Hoemmen fix Tpetra::CrsMatrix::apply method with a 
TRANS combine mode.  Once this is done, remove creation of 
filterOperatorTpetra in ATO::Solver and ATOT::Solver, and
uncomment relevant apply code in copyObjectiveFromStateMgr 
routines.

3. Test/debug new ATOT::Solver by running tests with AlbanyT 
executable.  

Currently, the following tests seg fault when run:

- Constraint_2D_adj 
- Constraint_2D_fd
- DistParam_2D
- BodyForce_2D (uses NLopt) 
- CurrentOpt (uses NLopt)
- ResidualStrain (uses NLopt)
- VolumeObj_StiffnessCon (uses NLopt)
- VolumeObj_StressCon (uses NLopt) 

error in debug: 


p=0: *** Caught standard std::exception of type 'std::logic_error' :

 /home/ikalash/LCM/Trilinos/build-debug-no-dtk-ikt/install/include/Thyra_ModelEvaluatorBase_def.hpp:2102:
 
 Throw number = 1
 
 Throw test that evaluated to true: !deriv.isSupportedBy(derivSupport)
 
 Thyra::ModelEvaluatorBase::OutArgs<Scalar>::assert_supports(OUT_ARG_DgDp,j,l):

 Error, The argument DgDp(0,0) = Derivative{derivMultiVec=DerivativeMultiVector{multiVec=Thyra::TpetraMultiVector<double, int, int, Kokkos::Compat::KokkosDeviceWrapperNode<Kokkos::Serial, Kokkos::HostSpace> >{rangeDim=651,domainDim=1},orientation=DERIV_MV_BY_COL}}
 is not supported!
 
 The supported types include DerivativeSupport{DERIV_LINEAR_OP}!

Fixing this requires rewriting ATOT::Solver to call createOutArgs in evalModelImpl instead of in CreateSubSolver.


4. Once 3. is done, activate tests that run with AlbanyT executable. \

5. Check why some ATO test results (2Matl, RegHeaviside3D) seem to be workset-size dependent.  
This does not seem to have to do with the Tpetra/Thyra conversion but is noted in this file nonetheless.
