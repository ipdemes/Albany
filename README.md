# Albany

Albany is an implicit, unstructured grid, finite element code for the solution and analysis of multiphysics
problems. The Albany repository on the GitHub site contains hundreds of regression tests and examples
that demonstrate the code's capabilities on a wide variety of problems including fluid mechanics, solid 
mechanics (elasticity and plasticity), ice-sheet flow, 
[quantum device modeling](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6242832), and many other applications.

## Features

### Analysis of complex multiphysics problems

### Software architecture

Albany heavily leverages the [Trilinos](https://trilinos.org) Framework, available at:

	git clone https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos.git

and optionally depends on the SCOREC Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure 
[http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/pumi](http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/pumi).

Albany supports the solution of very large problems (those over 2.1 billion degrees of freedom) using MPI, and
also demonstrates the use of the [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos) hardware abstraction package to support 
generic manycore computing across a variety of platforms - MPI + [threads, OpenMP, Cuda, Intel MIC].

In addition to supporting embedded sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, Albany can be tightly-coupled
to [Dakota](https://dakota.sandia.gov) using the Trilinos TriKota package.

## Building Albany

Detailed build instructions for both Trilinos and Albany are maintained on the Albany wiki at
[https://github.com/gahansen/Albany/wiki/Building-Albany-and-supporting-tools](https://github.com/gahansen/Albany/wiki/Building-Albany-and-supporting-tools)

## Nightly Build and Test Results

Ths nightly build results for the Trilinos and SCOREC libraries along with
Albany and the status of the Albany regression tests are posted on the Albany CDash site at
[http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Albany](http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Albany)

The regression test suite is contained within the Albany repository in the directories:

	/tests/small
	/tests/large

These tests are stand-alone and also serve as nice examples about how to describe various multiphysics problems.
They also serve as a template for developing new simulations.

Once Albany is built, the default test suite is executed by typing `ctest`
within the build directory. Any individual test can be executed by
moving into its sub-directory, and executing `ctest` in that
sub-directory. Many Albany tests run in parallel using up to 4 MPI ranks.
